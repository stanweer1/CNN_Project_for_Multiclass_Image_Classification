# CNN_Project_for_Multiclass_Image_Classification
## For Datacamp certification on Deep Learning

Code for the Datacamp project "Building an E-Commerce Clothing Classifier Model"

Uses deep learning to train a neural network for multiclass classification of garment types. Image classification is used to automatically categorize new product listings, making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for. The code uses dataset FashionMNIST from Pytorch to train and test the model.

Also has CI/CD automation for deploying the model to Hugging Face space. Find at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/stanweer/FashionMNIST_CNN_Predictor
